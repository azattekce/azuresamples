Depending on local resources and through your doc\u0027s office, you may benefit from counseling from a clinical psychologist via telemedicine in order to avoid exposure during lockdown. Use this time to connect to your loved ones remotely ( Skype, phone, etc) and talk about your worries.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
