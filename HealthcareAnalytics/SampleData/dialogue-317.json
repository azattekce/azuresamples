My chest feels slightly tight but I have no fever?\r\nDoctor:\r\nVirus. You have a viral respiratory tract infection and the absence of fever is reassuring at this time. Should fever or shortness of breath develop and if you\u0027re in an area where covid 19 is present, you should then call your MD for instructions. For now, drink adequate fluids, gargle with warm salt water. I also recommend using zinc lozenges and take acetaminophen. .\r\n\r\n"}
