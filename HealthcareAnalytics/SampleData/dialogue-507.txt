What drugs can I take if inhalers don\u2019t work?\r\nDoctor:\r\nGet meds refilled. With the COVID-19 pandemic, people with chronic conditions or even intermittent conditions should get their meds refilled in case pharmacy services close down. For asthma patients, they should refill their inhalers. Some use only an urgent \u0022rescue\u0022 inhaler like albuterol, while others also use \u0022preventive\u0022 inhalers like fluticasone. It\u0027s best to keep both on hand. If symptoms go bad, it\u0027s ER time.\r\n\r\n"}
