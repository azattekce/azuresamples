Is Nurofen safe now regarding ibuprofen and COVID19?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Basics   Fever is a normal body response when ill that increases circulation \u0026 oxygen supply to the tissues so natural healing comes faster.I would never treat minor fevers around 38 nor would I alternate  fever meds.  One or the other would be all I use when needed.  New data supports avoiding all ibuprofen products when corona virus may be present.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
