I\u2019ve sneezed a few times and sometimes my nose runs in the morning what could this be? Also sometimes I cough but not a lot. Any idea? Covid 19?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Probably not Covid.   May be allergic, bacterial sinus infection, a different virus, a narrow upper jaw with partial airway obstruction, or other causes.   Call your General Physician and check if they want to see you. See your Dentist to evaluate if your upper jaw is too narrow and if you need to see an Orthodontist.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
