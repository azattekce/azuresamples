{"Id":102,"Description":"What are the symptoms and treatment for pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nI have been ill for 6 weeks and my GP suspected pneumonia and I was put on antibiotics.  The third one has almost cleared the infection.  However, I had an X-ray and it apparently showed nothing at all, although all my symptoms were in line with pneumonia and my GP had definitely heard a lot of crackles in the left lung.  Is it possible that I had pneumonia if the Xray was clear?\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. For diagnosis of pneumonia, chest x ray need to have infiltration.With normal chest x ray, pneumonia is not possible. Cough, congestion, crackles on auscultation are also seen with bronchitis. And bronchitis shows normal chest x ray too.So it is quite possible that you improve within antibiotic because antibiotics also work in bronchitis. So I don\u0027t think you are having pneumonia because your chest x ray is normal. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
