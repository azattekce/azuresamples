Do I have Covid19?\r\nDoctor:\r\nHard to guess. You have some of the  symptoms of cold , flu and covid19 . Also you appear to be dehydrated. But you are young and no mention of any underlying medical condition. So, i  think you are not vulnerable.  Drink at least 6 cups of water a day. Probably need self isolation for 2 weeks and to be tested in mean time for covid19 if you develop breathing problem. Contact to your doctor for a guidance.\r\n\r\n"}
