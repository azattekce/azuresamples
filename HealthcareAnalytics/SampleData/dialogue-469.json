Should I be worried?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Life is not exact   In pandemic times, supplies are short.   Life is not that exact. That means 57.6% is fine, and if a person catches the coronavirus, it won\u0027t be because she was missing 2% on her hand sanitizer. Remember that the virus goes from person to person. If there are no people close by, and if the high-touch surfaces like table tops, keyboards, or doorknobs are clean, then one is a lot safer.
