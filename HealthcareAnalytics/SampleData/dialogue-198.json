I\u0027ve been treated with antibiotics however it doesn\u0027t feel like it has worked. Is it possible that this can be Covid-1?\r\nDoctor:\r\nHard to say. Is the mucous coloured or clear? Try to access health advice as you are. Stay home. It could be covid but if you are fairly asymptomatic stay home and keep asking questions on this platform. It is safer for you and others. Treat symptomatically for now. And keep asking on here.\r\n\r\n"}
