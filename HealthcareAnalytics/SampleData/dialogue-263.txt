Now a days I use it a lot due to Corona virus concerns.\r\nDoctor:\r\nAlcohol for Covid-19. Washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is extremely effective. Using an alcohol based hand sanitizer is a good second line of defense. Sanitizer contains emollient to help prevent dehydration. Straight alcohol doesn\u0027t. Follow all of the other published rules.\r\n\r\n"}
