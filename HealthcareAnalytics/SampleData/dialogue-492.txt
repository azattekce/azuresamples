I am in my third trimester. Should I take leave until my maternity leave starts due to the coronavirus pandemic? Government has not made any recommendations for pregnant healthcare workers\r\nDoctor:\r\nNot a bad idea. Many pharmacists also are trying to work from home whenever possible. Your best reference going forward will be your Obs-gyn doc and based on your institution\u0027s flexibility and further government regulations either work from home, if possible, or go in maternity leave.\r\n\r\n"}
