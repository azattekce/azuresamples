By looking at your child you\u0027ll know if he is having breathing difficulties.   Cough with a runny nose is common in children. You should be concerned only if he is refusing to play and eat, or if he develops breathing difficulties. Having a fever doesn\u0027t mean he has the Coronavirus. He is more likely to be infected with any of the common infections in your area of Gauteng.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
