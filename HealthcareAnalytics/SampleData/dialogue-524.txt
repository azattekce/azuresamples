It sounds like a viral upper airway infection( anti histamines, paracetamol, Ponstan will suffice for a day)If she gets worse, she can be checked by a doctor.If she was not in contact with a positive patient, no need for testing.Stay home,  lots of fluids, rest, meds and observe .Monitor her temp as well.RegardsDr Wil.\r\n\r\n"}
