Can any coronavirus be transmitted sexually?\r\nDoctor:\r\nSort of. If you are having sex with someone who has Covid-19 you are quite at risk of getting it.  High likelihood if kissing and having intercourse but it may not be transmitted through intercourse but the closeness in an intimate situation like that with someone who is infected gives a high likelihood of transmission.\r\n\r\n"}
