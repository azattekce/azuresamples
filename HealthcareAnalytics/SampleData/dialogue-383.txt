Coronavirus and diarrhea\r\nDoctor:\r\nIt depends... Due to limited availability of covid testing, you probably wouldn\u2019t meet criteria for testing, unless you develop fever or cough, and you have chronic health problems or have been possibly exposed to covid.Seek care right away if difficulty breathing or severe symptoms.Seek online or phone consultation otherwise, to avoid exposure.Ultimately, patients who need treatment will have lung symptoms.\r\n\r\n"}
