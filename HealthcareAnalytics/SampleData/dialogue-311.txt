Unless you are using high end medical or industrial masks they do not protect you from any such virus. They prevent your cough or expired air from infecting others. Any scarf/fabric homemade mask or similar device will do the same. You protect yourself more by washing your hands often \u0026 not touching your face/mouth/nose with contaminated fingers.\r\n\r\n"}
