Is this COVID-19?\r\nDoctor:\r\nThe symptom pattern is not specific to one agent.\r\nIt suggests a cold and ear infection. Kids have been among those least affected by Covid-19 . Only proper screening and testing could confirm or exclude this or any other agent. Parainfluenza, rhinovirus, or RSV would be more likely.\r\n\r\n"}
