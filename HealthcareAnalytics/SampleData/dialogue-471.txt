Typically more sudden onset of fever and myalgias with influenza, but sometimes hard to tell. If no significant SOB probably need to quarantine. Call your local physician or health department. I know Healthtap has been helping to order or recommend test, but typically test not available. If Coronavirus most cases have been mild and expect about 10 days of symptoms.
