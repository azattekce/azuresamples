Been going on since Friday last week.\r\nDoctor:\r\nQuestions. Have you travelled, been in contact with a corona virus patient? Could very well be stress right now. WE are all really stressed and confused at this point in time. Be kind to yourself, breathe, do some exercise. :) We are here for you.\r\n\r\n"}
