Is it any thing related to covid?\r\nDoctor:\r\nProbably not. Fever and cough, headache, body aches are much more common. Please follow your symptoms, treat appropriately. Honey in hot tea, gargle with salt water, suck hard candy. Secrets/cepachol losenges should decrease symptoms. Good luck.\r\n\r\n"}
