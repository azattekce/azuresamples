{"Id":162,"Description":"What causes excessive tiredness despite taking antibiotics for pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nHello, On Friday, I was diagnosed with pneumonia and the chest x-ray states Minimal linear subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe. I have been taking an antibiotic since Friday. I am still feeling tired and drained. Is this to be expected with minimal linear subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe?\r\nDoctor:\r\nHey,Minimal linear atelectasis doesn\u0027t mean pneumonia of lung, but still if you are diagnosed as pneumonia then it\u0027s ok.And yes tiredness is expected for 4-5 days at least.\r\n\r\n"}
