Is this a sign of covid 19?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Source of bleeding   There are many causes of the small amount of blood in your sputum. You may have a nasal or upper airway source.    Strep infection, influenza are possible causes. COVID-19 typically is associated with fever, dry cough and/or shortness of breath.. Please contact your PCP for an evaluation, possible chest image and evaluation of the source of the bleeding.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
