Worried Daughter\r\nDoctor:\r\nRespected user, hi I evalauted your query thoroughly.Sorry to hear about the issue.*Prognosis depends on many factors - age - associated comorbid conditions   like heart attack / cv stroke / kidney malfunctions / diabetes - immunity  - haemoglobin level - body response to treatment - competency of doctors  - efficacy of molecules used in treatment \u0026 much more list not possible to  narrate whole here.*Considering all your narrations, her prognosis is guarded, not that much  good as normal person suffering from pneumonia recovering in days. - She may take very long time for recovery \u0026 may not recover also ( I pray   to God that doesn\u0060t happen ) after your long jugglery with all ventilator   period. - I can suggest to see the progress of the patient on ventilator for 5-7 days   discuss with the consultant in details regarding this \u0026 then decide to    continue the treatment or wean her off from ventilator for resting her   sole in peace. Hope this clears your query. Thanks for using Health care magic \u0026 keeping trust in our medical services Regards\r\n\r\n"}
