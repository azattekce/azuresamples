{"Id":78,"Description":"What are the risks of smoking while treating pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nHi, I got diagnosed with Pneumonia yesterday and have been sent home with antibiotics (amoxicillin and doxycycline) I was just wondering what the risk factors would be if I were to have at least one cigarette? I know it wouldn\u2019t be good for the healing process(will probably slow it down) but is there any serious risk with smoking (ciggerattes or maybe even weed mixed with tobacco?) my doctor at the hospital that diagnosed me knew I smoked and also knew I smoked at least one or two bongs and he said NOTHING when I was leaving about trying not to smoke etc etc?\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello,The tobacco with or without seeds will contribute to bronchi spasm effects and hamper the pneumonia condition to a great extent. In our clinic, we strongly recommend quitting all tobacco items till complete recovery.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,  Dr. Bhagyesh V. Patel\r\n\r\n"}
