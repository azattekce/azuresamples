It is basically an abscess in the chest cavity. And the correct treatment for it is drainage - which was done appropriatley. But he should receive antibiotic treatment with coverage of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Usually specimens are send from the procedure to see which organisms grow and provide a more directed antibiotic coverage.\r\n\r\n"}
