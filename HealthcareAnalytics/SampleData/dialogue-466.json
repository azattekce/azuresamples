Any tips on what I can do?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Cervix trauma   One technique is to have your partner only penetrate your vagina half way to avoid trauma to the cervix.   You and your partner can still have enough stimulation and pleasure this way.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
