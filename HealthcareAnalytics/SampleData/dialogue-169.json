{"Id":169,"Description":"What are symptoms of pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nI recently got over either the flu or pnemonia. I\u0027ve noticed my feces are increasingly yellow or whitish. I had quit smoking thrity days ago and have been on the nicotine gum and now the lozenges. I don\u0027t feel bad, but this is unusual. Could the nicotine products be contributing to the discoloration? Thank you.\r\nDoctor:\r\nHiIf a patient have pneumonia he should have cough with or without sputum,probably chest pain and breathlessness,anorexia,fever.But the signs and symptoms varies from patient to patient.Take careDr.jolanda\r\n\r\n"}
