I\u2019m in such a panic about it.\r\nDoctor:\r\nDepends-all factors. Type I diabetics can be more fragile when they have any type of infection unfortunately. If you are younger \u0026 do not smoke \u0026 do not have other chronic problems, your increased risk may be minimal.  Eating balanced diet, keeping glucose controlled, getting adequate exercise (including fresh air outdoors), \u0026 adequate sleep all should help protect you from severe consequences, but be very careful ! .\r\n\r\n"}
