They are not effective for viral infections like coVid 19 with no bacterial lung involvement either. If you\u0027ve been exposed to someone with coVid 19 or or if you or someone you were exposed to travelled to a region where it was endemic, get tested  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
