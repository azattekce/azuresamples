Have not been in contact with Nyone with the virus.\r\nDoctor:\r\nDuring this pandemic. Throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza or other virus, or from some other cause such as allergies or irritants. Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn\u0027t go away quickly. COVID-19 infections tend to have cough, whereas strep throat usually lacks cough but has more throat pain. (3/21/20)\r\n\r\n"}
