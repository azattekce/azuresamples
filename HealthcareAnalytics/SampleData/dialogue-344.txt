Should I get tested for COVID-19?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Hard to say   New Zealand is definitely lower risk than Europe.   Your best bet is to stay home, with masks on (home made) follow hygiene. If you need more help ask another question here. If you have access to testing you could do it but I think we need the tests for folk who are more ill at this stage. Hope this makes sense.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
