(covid)?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Likely nerve pain   this diagnosis would require a visit and imaging but the most likely cause is either pressure on a nerve in your neck or referred pain from the neck and shoulder with symptoms felt at the shoulder/shoulder blade.    Try to use the chlorzoxazone or an NSAID (ibuprofen or naproxen) or a combo of both and also try ice for pain, heat for stiffness or spasms.  It doesn\u0027t sound at all like COVID-19.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
