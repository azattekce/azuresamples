{"Id":99,"Description":"Are cough and sore throat symptoms of pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nI was swimming in a pool on 2/15 and I slipped and went under the water unexpectedly and I wound up choking quite badly on some water.  I couldn\u0027t catch my breath and I felt like I had water in my lung that I couldn\u0027t expel with coughing.  Yesterday I began having a hacking cough and a sore throat (fells like my throats on fire).  Today I feel even worse, my cough is worse and sounds more \u0022cruddy\u0022 and my throat still hurts, my head is pounding and my body is starting to ache.  Could I be developing aspiration pneumonia?\r\nDoctor:\r\nHelloIf the situation has been very short under the water i do not think it might be aspiration pneumonia.RegardsDr.Jolanda\r\n\r\n"}
