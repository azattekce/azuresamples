I have no symptoms. Is it possible to opt to get tested?\r\nDoctor:\r\nNot advised to test . The test currently used is a genetic test which test for the virus genetics. Therefor if you are tested while asymptomatic, it will not test positive, even though you might actually be infected.Rather stay under self quarantine and test if you show some signs.\r\n\r\n"}
