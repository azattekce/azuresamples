We presume one is immune to a respiratory virus for a while after getting the infection (that\u0027s the way it is with other viruses). A few people have trouble with their antibodies and don\u0027t have much immunity. Shedding of viruses sometimes is longer than 14 days. In life, there will always be some people who get reinfected, for whatever reason. Usually one is immune after the infection. (3/21/20)\r\n\r\n"}
