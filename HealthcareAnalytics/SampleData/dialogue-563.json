I don\u0027t have shortness of breath or any other COVID-19 symptoms, except some fatigue. I have been traveling a lot in high risk areas. Should I get tested?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Yes   I would advise screening due to your exposure.   Fever is very commonly associated with COVID-19. Stay at home, rest, drink fluids and monitor your temperature. Arrange the testing which also  may include a chest image with your PCP.  Since your have been traveling, a pulmonary embolism is another possible cause of your shortness of breath.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
