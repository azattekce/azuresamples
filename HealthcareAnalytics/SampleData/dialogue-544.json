I don\u0027t experience simultaneous on both lungs and it not always at the hame position. I don\u0027t have a head nor do I have high temperature. I sneeze and cough maybe once a day. Do I have corona, should I get tested?\r\nDoctor:\r\nExam needed. You are assuming that the discomfort is coming from both lungs, but pain of pleurisy or pneumonia wouldn\u0027t come and go In different sites. I doubt your symptoms are lung related, but fever, chills, sweats, worse cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, warrant testing.. If you\u0027ve been exposed to someone with covid, or if you or someone you were exposed to  travelled to an affected region, get tested.\r\n\r\n"}
