{"Id":174,"Description":"Suggest management of complete lung whiteout with invisible heart outline and pneumonia\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nMy father is in the hospital on ventilator currently.  The doctor says he now has what is considered whiteout in his lungs.  He has said that the outline of the heart can no longer be seen.  My father aspirated and then was diagnosed with pneumonia.  Three days later he ended up in ccu on a ventilator and has not been able to be weened off/  He is currently taking 3 antibiotics.  What is your advise.\r\nDoctor:\r\nLung whiteout and loss of heart outline are findings of chest x-ray compatible with many abnormal conditions affecting the lungs, like pneumonia, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome among others. In the actual setting, your father is already receiving treatment to his pneumonia. All the other possibilities are probably been considerated and adressed by CCU staff. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is sometimes challenging because many factors can impair patients evolution, like how long he\u0027s been in MV, his nutrition status, his cardiovascular performance and resolution of the cause that led him to MV in the first place.\r\n\r\n"}
