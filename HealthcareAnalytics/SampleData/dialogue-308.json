I\u0027ve been stressing about the whole pandemic and will seldom go to sleep after 11 each night. Could it be lack of sleep or anxiety at play?\r\nDoctor:\r\nYes. Could well be and that is very normal. SEe how you go, you do have some worrying symptoms. Try to do a telephonic consult and if you have access get tested. In the interim self isolate and listen to Cyril\u0027s advice. Be calm, we are here.\r\n\r\n"}
