{"Id":82,"Description":"Do severe headache, tingling head and nose, pain in lower chest and chills mean pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nHello, im a female of 26, heavy smoker with last breath reading of 33 and drink daily. On Thursday I suffered from a severe headache which stayed until Friday evening, as the headache subsided I had a tingling and pressure sensation over head which was also over my nose. I have had no fever, cold etc Yesterday I felt very lightheaded and also after an episode of diarrea this morning am lightheaded again... I have no trouble breathing as such but I suffer from anxiety which I think has been happening alot today. I have had some twinge type pains in my lower chest ( like at the bottom of ribs) for a few days but not necessarily when I breath in and out and when I do cough I have had mucus? Come up, it s almost like it s stuck in my throat also.... I have some head pressure and am getting cold feet every now and then everything I ve checked says pneumonia does this sound like what I could have or could it just be anxiety, I m a little worried...the symptoms separately come and go but my head stays feeling.a little heavy! Chills now and again\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello,According to history, yes, it might be\u00A0pneumonia,\u00A0but you should do a chest x-ray.\u00A0Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Jnikolla\r\n\r\n"}
