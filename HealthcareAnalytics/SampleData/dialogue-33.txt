{"Id":33,"Description":"Can pneumonia cause blood in urine?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nMy father recently passed over the weekend. His body was fighting an infection along with pneumonia for 1 week. During that time, he would urinate bloody urine into the foley. The doctors said that was completely normal. It was very dark red. Is that normal?\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello,\r\n * The pneumonia does not give rise to red urine called hematuria.\r\n* There can be possible causes for red blood cells in the urine as\r\n - uncontrolled urinary tract infection\r\n- kidney damage via systemic sepsis\r\n- abnormal clotting factors or platelet function\r\n- side effects of drugs\r\n- dehydration related\r\n- secondary effects of diabetes\r\n- others\r\n * Kindly share all reports if available with you for further discussion ahead and guide in details.\r\n Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.\r\n Take care\r\n Regards,\r\nDr Bhagyesh V. Patel, General Surgeon\r\n\r\n"}
