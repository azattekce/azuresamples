What steps do i need to take going forward? Should I get tested immediately?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Yes   My opinion is yes, but the criteria for testing is quite stringent right now.   Perhaps telephonically consult your doctor if possible to discuss more fully. My opinion would be to access testing.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
