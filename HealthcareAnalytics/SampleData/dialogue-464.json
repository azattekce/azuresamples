What can I really do? It\u2019s inevitable.\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   COVID prevention   It\u0027s not inevitable.   Follow the guidelines all over the media and make sure your kids do too:  social distancing, wash hands frquently, stay home except for absolutely necessary trips, wash hands frequently, use antiseptic wipes when you have to touch surfaces outside the home (e.g. shopping cart handles), and avoid touching your face. At your and your kids\u0027 age, most infections aren\u0027t serious.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
