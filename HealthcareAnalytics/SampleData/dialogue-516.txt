Awareness and precautions are important, but your wife plays a valuable role for those who have contracted the disease. She will be at higher risk than the general population and we are seeing HCPs contracting Covid-19. There is no one correct answer to this question because situations vary. Best option is for your wife to discuss this with her employer and take precautions. Good luck!\r\n\r\n"}
