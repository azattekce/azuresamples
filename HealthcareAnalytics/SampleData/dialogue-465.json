Treatment would be resting, drinking adequate fluids and taking acetaminophen. Chest discomfort or shortness of breath would be concerning and if you\u0027ve been exposed to anyone with covid19, who has been in an affected region or if you live in a region where covid19 is present, notify your MD and get tested.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
