Am coughing a bit but do not have a cold. Did notice a little mucos over the past couple of days. could the pneumonia be back?  typcially i ma in great shape\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Pneumonia can recur.So better to first rule out pneumonia for your symptoms.So get done chest x ray.If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for pneumonia or other lung disease.Take simple painkiller like paracetamol or ibuprofen. Apply warm water pad on affected areas.You will mostly improve with all these.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
