If the visited place has a high rate of coronavirus infections to take some precautions is important such as if you develop fever or cough or any other coronavirus infection symptoms.   To be tested is desired but will you be able to get tested? In some places testing kits are reserved to very sick and hospitalized patient. Self quarantine in cooperation with your doctor is the way to go.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
