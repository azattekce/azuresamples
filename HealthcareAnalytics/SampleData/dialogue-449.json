Itching  is pretty specific for allergies.  If worsens  or develops fever would seek medical attention for sinusitis versus viral  infection including coronavirus these days   but as stated itching  is pretty diagnostic of allergies.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
