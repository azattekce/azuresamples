Any sign of that yet?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief: COVID-19 mortality\r\nDon\u0027t confuse actual mortality rate with REPORTED rate.\r\nThe actual rate probably will remain stable (and likely lower in the US than some other countries, because of sophisticated intensive medical care). But as testing expands and more people with mild symptoms (or no symptoms) are diagnosed, reported mortality will decline; likely happening now, but it may take weeks for data to be known.\r\n\r\n"}
