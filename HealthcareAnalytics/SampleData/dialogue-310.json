Now I still have a sore throat and burning on my chest?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Can give Dr. a call   Throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza (antibiotics usually not used), or from some other cause such as allergies or irritants.   Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn\u0027t go away quickly. COVID-19 infections tend to have cough, whereas strep usually lacks cough but has more throat pain.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
