Thanks\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief: Not quite that way\r\nPeople with chronic lung problems do worse in a lung disease outbreak.\r\nFor one specific person... well, there\u0027s no way to guess. \u0022People\u0022 in general do worse if they have UNcontrolled lung disease. That means it\u0027s likely that asthmatics using inhaled steroids to give them good disease control will be BETTER OFF than asthmatics who use steroids but still cannot get good control. Be in good control.\r\n\r\n"}
