The facts are your nose \u0026 upper airway add humidity to the air you breathe to the point it reaches ~100% at the level of air exchange. Vaporizers help loosen thicker mucus in the upper airways so you can cough it up, but it would not have any effect on the deep airways or any germs that reach them. .\r\n\r\n"}
