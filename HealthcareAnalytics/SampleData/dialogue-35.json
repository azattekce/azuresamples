My grandfather is suffering from pneumonia right now and refuses to go to the doctor because of the price needed to obtain a patented medicine. In Indonesia, it is not hard to find these kinds of doctors that don t want to help people in need. What medicine can you guys recommend for a home treatment?\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello,\r\n As you explain the situation, unfortunately, there is no home treatment for pneumonia. I strongly recommend you to go to the hospital as an emergency which is free mostly.\r\n Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.\r\n Regards,\r\nDr. Jnikolla, Pulmonologist\r\n\r\n"}
