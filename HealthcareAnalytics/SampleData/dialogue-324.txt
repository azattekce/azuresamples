Drink a lot of fluids, use acetaminophen/paracetamol (tylenol) for the fever and sore throat, eat/drink citrus and please stay home and away from the elders. Follow the recommendation of your local authorities.Only go to medical services if you feel shortness of breath and use masks if you feel sick and need to go out of your house  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
