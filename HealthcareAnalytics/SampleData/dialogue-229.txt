Also, does the flu vaccine in South Africa use live or dead viruses?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Flu vaccine   Any flu vaccine will cause your immune system to respond.  I advise,if your decision is to be vaccinated,to do it over a period of 6 weeks..I like a little bit on day 1 ,then more 2 weeks later and more two weeks later still.That way you get the full killed vaccine ,and your body develops an immune response with its ability still intact to fight Covid 19 if necessary.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
