Do I have to come in for a dr appointment on can this be done remotely given the Covid-19 lockdown?\r\nDoctor:\r\nYes. Yes you should come but it will not be a consultation depending the treatment you taking. If it is for HIV  you will need to go to the lab for for  bloods and if it is for hormone replacement there is no need for consultation but either way you have to call the practice reception to check f DR is available.\r\n\r\n"}
