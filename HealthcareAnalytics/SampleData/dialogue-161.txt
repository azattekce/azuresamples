After 1 week, I have finished the oral antibiotics. 2 days later, the sweats have returned (no temperature) and I am feeling generally unwell. I saw my doctor y day and I had another x-ray. My doctor rang to say there is no change but didn t recommend I do anything different. I have continued my physiotherapy to bring up whatever is in my lungs. The cramping I am now experiencing is excruciatingly painful. I just don t know what to do next. I live in a remote area and accessing a doctor or hospital is difficult.
