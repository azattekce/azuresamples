I use to swim daily in morning. Does COVID-19 spreads through water ? What precautions should I take to avoid infection?\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello and welcome to Ask A Doctor service.\r\nI have reviewed your query and here is my advice.\r\nFirst few cases were suspected to have spread from food. However human to human spread is mainly from air droplets.\r\nI would suggest you to refrain from swimming for sometime. Although the virus will get killed in swimming pool if it doesnot find host for more than few minutes.\r\nOther precautions include to avoid social gatherings, wash hands frequently with soap and water, cover face with mask, stay home during sickness, avoid travel.\r\nHope it helps. Let me know if I can assist you further.\r\nDr Vaishalee\r\n\r\n"}
