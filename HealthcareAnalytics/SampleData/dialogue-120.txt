She also has cough \u0026 colds. Doctos saif she has pneumonia and wants to give her antibiotic already. When i asked if its viral or bacterial, she said she doesn\u0027t know. How would you know if it is viral of bacterial? I\u0027m hesitant in giving her antibiotics because last month she took 2 kinds of antibiotics already.\r\nDoctor:\r\nhi hope to satisfy youactually there is an viral infection there must be superimposed bacteria infection too.viral resolves with the passage of time on its own but to treat bacterial one we have to give antibiotics.for pneumonia you should give her azithromycin according to her weight 10 mg /kg wight once a day and for 5 days.plz mention the age n weight for next onwards.also give ibuprofen 10 mg /kg weight three times a day for 3 days n for nasal congestion give give arinac syrup twice a day for 7 days.hope she feels better soon.\r\n\r\n"}
