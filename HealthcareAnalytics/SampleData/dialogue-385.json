I\u0027m writing from the U.  S., and I\u0027m not sure of the availability of vaccination for influenza in your area.  However, with the coronavirus pandemic, getting your flu shot is a good idea, if possible.  It\u0027s always a good idea, but, also, though it won\u0027t protect you from coronavirus, you could get both. And, if you get the flu, not knowing if it\u0027s flu or coronavirus presents complications.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
