{"Id":40,"Description":"Are there long term repercussions of not treating pneumonia which was diagnosed 5 months ago?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nMy 19 year old son was diagnosed with pneumonia 5 months ago and was given antibiotics but with minimal results. Unfortunately he still suffers from the same symptoms but since he is in the military he refuses to go back to the doctor for fear of reprisal. His cough is still deep and his energy is low. Are there any long term repercussions for his lungs if he continues without treatment.\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello,\r\n As you explain the situation I strongly recommend you to send him to the doctor for a re-evaluation of the situation.\r\n Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.\r\n Regards,\r\nDr. Jnikolla, Pulmonologist\r\n\r\n"}
