{"Id":103,"Description":"What are the symptoms of recovery from pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\ni am a 14 year old female that was recently diagnosed with a slight bit of pneumonia, i took the antibiotics that i was supposed to take: once a day for 6 days, i completed it. But I want to know if I\u0027m know cured, it\u0027s been a week or two since I finish the tablet treatment, How can I tell that i\u0027m cured?\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. If you are not having fever, cough or chest pain after completing antibiotics, you are probably cured from pneumonia. You are should also get done chest x ray. If recent chest x ray is showing normal results or resolving infiltration then you are cured from pneumonia. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
