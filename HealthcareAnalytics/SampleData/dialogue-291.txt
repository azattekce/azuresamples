Please advise.\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Isolate sick people   Throat pain can be from a strep throat (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza, or from some other cause such as allergies or irritants.   Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn\u0027t go away quickly. The flu or COVID-19 usually have cough, fever, body aches; whereas strep is mainly sore throat. Can call doctor by video or phone.
