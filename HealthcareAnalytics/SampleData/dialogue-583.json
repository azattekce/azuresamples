Stay at home, rest, drink fluids and monitor your temperature. Your symptoms are more consistent with a cold or sinus infection. Nasal saline and a decongestant may be helpful. If you develop COVID symptoms including dry cough, fever, and/or shortness of breath, testing is indicated. Report fever and shortness of breath to your PCP.\r\n\r\n"}
