I started working out about a year ago. I noticed some lower abdominal pain after partaking in abdominal workouts. But also notice it around the time of my period. It\u2019s right next to/under my hip bone on left side.\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   This could well be very normal.   One can get pain on day 14 during ovulation and before and during the period. Use panado for this and once we are through this corona virus you can use anti-inflammatories.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
