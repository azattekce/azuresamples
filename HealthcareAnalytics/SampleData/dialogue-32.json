{"Id":32,"Description":"Can a pneumonia shot raise your white blood cell count?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nLast tuesday I had a flu shot and a neumonia shot. I am 68 and male. I had a very sore arm and felt bad the next day in which I had blood drawn for a test. The results showed a high white cell blood count as well as high ANC and AMC. Could these high readings be because of the shots the day before?\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello,\r\n * The pneumonia shot per se is not responsible for high WBC count, but as you are telling there are soreness and bad feeling at the injection site over arm, there are all possibilities that you have cellulitis or possible abscess formation at the injection site; which will recruit neutrophils at the site and cause secondary rise in WBC count.\r\n * Primary relief with ice application and secondary management with systemic antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines with your doc.\r\n Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.\r\n Take care\r\n Regards,\r\nDr Bhagyesh V. Patel, General Surgeon\r\n\r\n"}
