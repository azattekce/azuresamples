{"Id":45,"Description":"Suggest treatment for chronic pneumonia\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nHi, I m a 55 yr old white female, 5\u00604 , 180 lbs. I had childhood asthma and bronchitis, and were given steroids frequently. I seemed to grow out of it at age 17. During the last 14 yrs I ve developed Fibromyalgia/Chronic Fatigue, RA, for 14 months my SED rate stayed at 53-108 and they could not find out why, Cushing s Syndrome, neuropathy of the feet, and most importantly - Hypogammagobulinemia. I rec d IGG iv s monthly for 4 yrs, then lost insurance 6 yrs. ago. I m disabled and on Medicare, I haven t rec d IV s in 6 yrs. During that time I ve had pneumonia 17 times, once was septic pneumonia, constant sinus problems, PCP infection and a rare form of arthritis associated with the hypo (the Dr. couldn t tell me the name of it). I have contacted Medicare, foundations and pharm companies trying to get help to start treatment again. Reaching out to any possible help has been met with apathy and no one would try to point me in the right direction. I m really worried and would like to know my chances of surviving if I can t get the IGG treatments. Thank you very much for your time.\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello,\r\n The cause of chronic pneumonia is mandatory to be evaluated here with culture of bronchial lavage fluid, CT scan of the thorax and other supportive evaluations.\r\n Unless the root cause is identified, one cannot get the complete management chart.\r\n Hope I have answered your query. Feel free to post further doubts.\r\n Thank you.\r\n Regards,\r\nDr. Bhagyesh V. Patel, General Surgeon\r\n\r\n"}
