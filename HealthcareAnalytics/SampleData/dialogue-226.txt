Help!\r\nDoctor:\r\nCOVID-19? It sounds like your mom is in good hands. If she has COVID, they will know how to treat it. If the pneumonia is beleived to be bacterial, they will treat with antibiotics. There is no proved effective treatment for coronavirus itself. Ask her doctors if she is a candidate for remdesivir -- not proved effective but sometimes available on a \u0022compassionate\u0022 basis for severely ill patients. Good luck.\r\n\r\n"}
