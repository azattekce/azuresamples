Will it be safe to fly. Please advise. your anticipated help will be appreciated.\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.You have given oral antibiotic for pneumonia.This itself suggests that you are had walking pneumonia (no serious type).Levofloxacin is broad spectrum antibiotic and usually sufficient for walking pneumonia.So if you are don\u0027t have fever or coughing at present and feel good then you can definitely fly. No harm in it.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
