Feels like I am about to cough sometimes but no cough. Then when I stand upright it\u0027s worse. No fever. Possible exposure to covid from gibs university but not sure. Really burning sensation on my chest.\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Consider asthma    Have you ever had asthma or wheezing? That can cause tightness \u0026 shortness of breath, as can certain heart problems.   Without fever \u0026 cough, COVID 19 is less likely, but probably best to call your Dr\u2019s office for recommendation.  If the breathing worsens you should be seen ASSP by video visit or perhaps in person to listen to lungs \u0026 assess need for possible chest X-ray, EKG, \u0026 medication  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
