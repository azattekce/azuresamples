Some anecdotal data showed that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine might have activity against COVID-19. Observation from China Wuhan noted that patients with RA and on these medications had low incidence of COVID-19 infection. There is however no definite proof yet at this time.  In terms of whether you can stop methotrexate, you better discuss with your rheumatologist for the benefit and risk. .\r\n\r\n"}
