If, however, you are having an allergic reaction to the medication it can cause a fever. But so can viral diseases (common cold, Flu, Covid-19, etc.  ) that are not treatable with antibiotics that are designed to treat bacterial infections. Call your General Physician and report your symptoms.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
