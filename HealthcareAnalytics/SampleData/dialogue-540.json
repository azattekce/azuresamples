Bacteria are living creatures, like the rest of us. Viruses are missing some parts so are not living unless they are inside another living creature. Viruses that are by themselves are dormant like seeds or spores, waiting to be reactivated. In a general sense, it is fine to think of viruses as living things, but technically speaking, they are not independently living when alone.\r\n\r\n"}
