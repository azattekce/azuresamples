{"Id":72,"Description":"What causes persistent pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nHow much will this cost? I have had pneumonia 8 time last year. Not 1 specialist could find the bacteria causing this. By December of that year I almost passed away. I had just been dismissed by a hospital and sent home, and 1 hour layer I could barely breathe. I was filling up with fluid and foamy blood was coming out. The paramedics saved me and took me to another hospital The drs. found a serious heart condition, still waiting for open heart surgery. I fill up to my bronchials with fluid every few weeks, it bubbles up and I can hear gurgling. I have no lung problems, such as copd, or emphasyma. What can I do.\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello and Welcome to \u2018Ask A Doctor\u2019 service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.As per your history and description, the possibility of end-stage heart disease leads to heart failure is more likely. Surgical treatment is best for this. So try to get it done urgently as soon as possible.Diuretics and other cardiac supportive drugs are advisable until surgery. So better to consult the cardiologist and try for early surgery.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Kaushal Bhavsar\r\n\r\n"}
