That\u0027s because a healthy person under 50 won\u0027t die (has maybe half a percent chance of dying) from COVID-19, but a guy aged 70-80 has a 7-8% chance of dying from this... about the same as a non-elderly diabetic. That means the old guy and the diabetic both have about a 92-93% chance of NOT dying. (3/25/20)  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
