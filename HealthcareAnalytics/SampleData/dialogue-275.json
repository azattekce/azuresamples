About 7 days I feel same allergic problem in my thort and tongue I have 1 canker sore. I take just anti histamine. But ago I treat this with prednisone. Does it covid 19?\r\nDoctor:\r\nCan call Dr on video. Throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza, EB virus, or from some other cause such as allergies, irritants, or acid reflux. Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn\u0027t go away quickly. COVID-19 infections tend to have cough, whereas strep usually lacks cough but has more throat pain.\r\n\r\n"}
