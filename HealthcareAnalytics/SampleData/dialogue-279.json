For the past two days I have been feeling dizzy. Should I contact my dr? Should I see a dr\r\nDoctor:\r\nYes. Protection. It is not enough symptoms to say that you are a suspect case of COVID19; but, independently of this, if you have been in contact with a case, or you present persistent cough (with or without sputum), shortness of breath, wheezing, or you have a chronic disease like diabetes, hypertension, low immune system or cancer, should ask for medical attention. And use all the protection measures.\r\n\r\n"}
