I don\u2019t feel anything else so far and I\u2019ve only felt it a few hours\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Yes:   Not wheezing but difficulty of breathing is a symptom of the corona virus infection but it is not the common one.   It can be seen sometimes. The common symptoms are fever and cough mostly dry cough. The wheezing could be due to asthma or allergies in general. Since covid 19 can be seen even without any symptoms i suggest you to get in touch with your doctor for advise and follow up with you.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
