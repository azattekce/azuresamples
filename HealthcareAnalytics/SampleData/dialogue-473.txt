Some medications are refillable by video, others are not. In this pandemic, one\u0027s primary care doctor, who knows the patient well, can usually get meds to the patient without an in-person visit... unless an exam is needed in order to adjust the meds. Just ask the doctor.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
