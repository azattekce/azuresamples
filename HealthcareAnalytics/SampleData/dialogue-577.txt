Stay at home, monitor your temperature, drink fluids and rest.   If your cough is associated with fever and/or does not begin to improve, please see your PCP.  You may have bacterial bronchitis -avoid smoke, dust, mold, animal dander and pollen. Influenza and COVID are associated with fever. The cough with COVID is typically dry.
