In my house, we take off shoes and outside clothes at the door after we enter. The clothes go immediately into the laundry, we wash our hands with soap and water, then put on \u0022house clothes\u0022. Different from \u0022public\u0022 clothes. We try to prevent the potential introduction of the virus into out home. Once inside, everything is clean.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
