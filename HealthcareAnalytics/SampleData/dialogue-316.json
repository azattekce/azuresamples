However if fever, chills, heavier cough, or breathing difficulties develop, call your MD for instructions. For now, drink adequate fluids, gargle with warm salt water. I recommend also using zinc lozenges and take acetaminophen. Don\u0027t infect others regardless of what type of infection you have.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
