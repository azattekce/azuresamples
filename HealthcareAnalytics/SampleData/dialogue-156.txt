She gave me a shot ofantibiotics and steroids. She also wroteme a prescription for Bactrim DS andcough syrup. The cough syrup isn\u0027tworking, I\u0027m up all night coughing, Ihaven\u0027t slept for more than 30 min sinceSaturday. I feel worse than I didyesterday. What should I do? Any Advice?Thanks!\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you need higher antibiotic,inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for your current symptoms. Constant coughing at night can be due to worsening of pneumonia or bronchitis. So consult pulmonologist and get done chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is for pneumonia and PFT is for bronchitis. Don\u0027t worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
