You have posted on our free, public, informational forum, where doctors do not see patient charts nor give medical care. Try a private consultation where doctors can see you on video. Also, in the US certain medications (but not all) can be prescribed or temporarily refilled, depending on individual circumstances. Start over on your screen, click on Care, then Talk-to-Doctor.
