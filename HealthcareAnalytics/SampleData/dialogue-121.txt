{"Id":121,"Description":"Can Pneumococcal vaccine be taken after being diagnosed with pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nHello Doctor, I am COPD patient. I was taken a vaccine called Pneumo 23 almost 4years and 8months ago. The doctor advised me to take the vaccine once in every 5 years. But before the completion of 5 year I am diagnosed with Pneumonia. What should I do? Should I take the vaccine before the completion of 5 year period? Please advise.\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Pneumococcal vaccine is live attenuated vaccine. So it is contraindicated in active infections like pneumonia because it can flare up infection. So better not to take pneumococcal vaccine at present. Get complete cure from current pneumonia and then take pneumococcal vaccine. Don\u0027t worry if time period between two vaccine is more than 5 years.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
