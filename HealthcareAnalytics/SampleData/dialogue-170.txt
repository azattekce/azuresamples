{"Id":170,"Description":"How to treat walking pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nMy fianc\u00E9 has been coughing uncontrollably every night for the past 4 months. He is 23 years old, 5\u00279\u0022, about 140 lbs., and has been told by his dr that he has walking pneumonia. He has been prescribed antibiotics, cough syrup, allergy medicine, mucinex, nasal sprays, and inhalers and although they suppress the coughing at times he still does not seem to have gotten rid of the coughing. His coughing is accompanied with phlegm and has also caused him to throw up due to the extremity. He does smoke cigars as well. What is this!?\r\nDoctor:\r\nWalking pneumonia is a non-medical term to describe a mild case of pneumonia. It is usually called atypical pneumonia because the disease is different from more serious cases of pneumonia caused by typical bacteria. it is often the result of a lung infection from a bacterial microorganism called Mycoplasma pneumoniae and generally treated with antibiotics. Mild infections are often not treated because they tend to clear on their own. With treatment, most people begin to feel better within a few days.\r\n\r\n"}
