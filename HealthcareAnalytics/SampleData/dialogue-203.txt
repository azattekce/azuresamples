My other symptoms this morning were stuffy nose and a bit on the sore side with my body?\r\nDoctor:\r\nLikely not corona. Sounds more like seasonal allergy or a mild cold. GArgle with warm salt water and use meds you have at home. Ask questions on this forum - don\u0027t go out unless you really really have to.\r\n\r\n"}
