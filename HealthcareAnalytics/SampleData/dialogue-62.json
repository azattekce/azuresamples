{"Id":62,"Description":"What causes right-sided chest pain while having pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nI am recovering from pnuemonia. I was thinking that that I tore a muscle coughing but now I am beginning to wonder. On the right side of my chest, under my breast it hurts when I cough. It hurts when I press on it, but when I pinchthe muscles with my fingers I have no tenderness. It hurts as i go to touch my toes. Could I be having a problem with an organ under my ribs ? I have no pain on my left side.\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello and Welcome to \u2018Ask A Doctor\u2019 service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.\r\n Pneumonia can cause pleurisy (inflammation of pleura) and this can cause similar kind of pain. So in my opinion, you should first get the chest X-ray done. If the chest X-ray is worsening, then your pain is due to pneumonia and you will need higher antibiotics. But if the chest X-ray is improving, then possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So apply warm water pad on the affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid sudden jerky movements of the chest. Take simple painkillers and muscle relaxant drugs like Ibuprofen and Thiocolchicoside. Don\u0027t worry, you will be alright with all these. \r\n Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
