Possible covid-19?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   It is possible.    You can self quarantin yourself for 2 weeks.   If develop and symptoms especially fever and cough get tested. Since you consider yourself a hypocondriac i suggest to wear an N-95 or surgical mask to prevent similar situations.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
