You can use over the counter drugs for symptomatic treatment in the mean time. If sore throat get worse this could be strep throat need a culture to be taken from your throat by your doctor followed by antibiotic. If shortness of breath gets worse call the hospital for the inpatient treatment could be for Covid-19.\r\n\r\n"}
