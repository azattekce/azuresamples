Isolate yourself and contact to your doctor by phone or via internet.   You may have flu more than corona virus. Because headache is not a common symptom of the corona virus and your age is not the age that is vulnarable to corona virus.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
