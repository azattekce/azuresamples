    "The primary objective is to improve the simplistic greedy decoding often used in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. In this technique, several diverse reasoning paths are sampled through few-shot CoT. The responses generated from these paths are then evaluated, and the most consistent answer is selected. This method has a significant impact on enhancing the effectiveness of CoT prompting, particularly in tasks that require arithmetic and commonsense reasoning. \n",
